1.) As an active person, I would like to be able do explore and plan future workouts so that I can be more prepared when I arrive to the gym.

2.) As a person with a low income, I would like some workout options that require no equipment so that I can workout at home using only the app.

3.) As a last minute planner, I would like to reorder my workouts at anytime so that I can perform my workout how I want to.
